# guessing-game

> Let's play a guessing game

This is an interactive guessing game. The computer picks a random number. You guess. If you don't get it right, the computer will give you a hint -- _higher_ or _lower_. Keep guessing until you get it right.

This is a tiny command line program written in [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) and compiled natively using `bsb-native`.
